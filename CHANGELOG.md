# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Agent SDK for Go are documented in this file.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- Permission mode support with proper CLI flag passing
- Verbose logging option that can be enabled via `ClaudeAgentOptions.Verbose`
- System prompt support via `--system-prompt` flag to Claude CLI
- Permission prompt tool flag (`--permission-prompt-tool stdio`) for control protocol

### Fixed
- Control request handling for CLI-initiated requests without `request_id`
  - SDK now automatically generates request IDs for CLI-initiated control requests
  - Fixes permission callbacks that were failing silently
- Request ID parsing from top-level field in control_request messages
  - CLI sends `request_id` at top level, not inside request object
  - Fixes issue where control responses weren't matched to requests
  - Permission approvals are now properly recognized by CLI
- Client now properly passes options to transport layer
- Control protocol initialization and bidirectional communication

### Changed
- Enhanced control request logging for better debugging
- Updated `SubprocessCLITransport` to accept and use `ClaudeAgentOptions`
- Improved `SystemMessage` type with `RequestID` field for control protocol

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-18

  - Simple one-shot query example
  - Interactive multi-turn conversation
  - Tool permission callbacks for safety
  - Lifecycle hook events integration
- ✅ Updated README with feature descriptions
- ✅ API reference documentation

### Breaking Changes
None - this is the first release.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed CLI invocation command flags to use correct protocol format (#9)
  - Changed from `agent --stdio` to `--print --input-format=stream-json --output-format=stream-json --verbose`
